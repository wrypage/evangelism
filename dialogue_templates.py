    # Joe (Cultural Muslim)
    "hypocrisy": "You know, what gets to me most is when people claim to represent God but live double lives. That makes it hard for me to trust any of it.",
    "family honor": "My family has always taught me to live with dignity and protect our name. It’s hard to imagine a faith that could pull me away from that.",
    "freedom": "I’m not interested in rules and control. If faith means losing my freedom, then I’m out.",

    # Miranda (Progressive spiritual)
    "judgment": "That’s what frustrates me. Why does religion always seem to be about judging people?",
    "authenticity": "I’m drawn to people who are real. Don’t preach at me—just be honest about your struggles.",
    "freedom": "I don’t want a faith that tells me who I can be. I need space to figure that out on my own.",

    # Mark (Agnostic engineer)
    "irrationality": "I just can’t get behind something that requires me to shut off my brain. I need logic, not wishful thinking.",
    "moral failure": "I've seen religious leaders fail too many times. If even they can’t live it out, what does that say about the whole system?",
    "truth": "I’m chasing what’s real. If you’re just offering tradition or comfort, I’m not interested.",

    # Cassidy (Recovering addict)
    "hope": "I want to believe there’s still hope for someone like me. But it’s hard, you know?",
    "trust": "People have let me down so many times. I don’t just give my trust away anymore.",
    "pain": "You don’t know what I’ve been through. Don’t talk to me about God unless you’ve tasted real pain."

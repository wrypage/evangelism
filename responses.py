    "Joe": {
        "hypocrisy": "You know what bothers me? When people preach one thing and live another. That’s why I walked away from religion in the first place.",
        "family honor": "My family means everything. I’m not about to shame them chasing some belief that could divide us.",
        "freedom": "Honestly, I feel like religion takes away your freedom. Why should I give that up?",
    },
    "Miranda": {
        "judgment": "The second someone starts judging others, I shut down. Isn’t love supposed to be unconditional?",
        "authenticity": "I just want something real. If this Jesus stuff is real, it shouldn’t feel so fake or forced.",
        "freedom": "I’m not into boxes or rules. Spirituality should be freeing, not limiting.",
    },
    "Mark": {
        "irrationality": "If faith can’t stand up to logic, then it’s just superstition. I need reasons, not feelings.",
        "moral failure": "The biggest turn-off for me? Religious leaders who cover up abuse and corruption. Where’s the integrity?",
        "truth": "I’m after truth, even if it's uncomfortable. But it has to make sense — not just emotionally, but rationally.",
    },
    "Cassidy": {
        "hope": "Hope’s a hard thing for me. I’ve been burned before. What makes your hope any different?",
        "trust": "Trust doesn’t come easy anymore. Too many promises broken by people who said they cared.",
        "pain": "I’ve been through hell. I don’t need platitudes. I need to know someone understands.",
    }
